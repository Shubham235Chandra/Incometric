        Welcome to Incometric! This app helps you predict your potential income based on various personal and demographic factors. 
        By entering your information in the sidebar, you can receive an estimated income range and personalized financial advice.

        ### How It Works:
        1. **Input Your Information**: Provide details about your gender, education, occupation, marital status, living standards, and more.
        2. **Receive Income Prediction**: Based on the information you provide, the app predicts your potential income range.
        3. **Get Personalized Advice**: The app offers actionable recommendations to help you improve your financial stability and increase your income.
        ### Start by entering your information in the sidebar form!
                    
        #### Basic Information about the Inputs:

        - **Gender:** Select your gender from the options available (e.g., Male or Female). This helps to personalize the income prediction and advice based on gender-specific trends and data.
        - **Primary Mode of Transportation:** Choose the primary mode of transportation you use for your daily commute (e.g., Public transit, Biking, Car, or Walking). This provides insight into your commuting costs and lifestyle.
        - **Education Level:** Select the highest level of education you have completed (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate). Education level significantly impacts earning potential and career opportunities.
        - **Occupation:** Choose the sector in which you work (e.g., Technology, Finance, Education, Healthcare, or Others). Different occupations have varying income levels and growth prospects.
        - **Marital Status:** Select your current marital status (e.g., Married, Single, or Divorced). Marital status can affect household income, tax benefits, and financial planning.
        - **Living Standards:** Choose the living standard that best describes your situation (e.g., High, Medium, or Low). This helps to gauge your cost of living and disposable income.
        - **Homeownership Status:** Select whether you own or rent your home (e.g., Own or Rent). Homeownership status impacts your long-term financial stability and asset accumulation.
        - **Location:** Choose the type of area where you live (e.g., Urban, Suburban, or Rural). Location influences your cost of living, job opportunities, and lifestyle.
        - **Type of Housing:** Select the type of housing you reside in (e.g., Apartment, Single-family home, or Townhouse). This information helps to assess your housing expenses and living conditions.
        - **Employment Status:** Choose your current employment status (e.g., Full-time, Self-employed, or Part-time). Employment status directly affects your income and job security.
        - **Work Experience (in years):** Enter the number of years you have been working. More years of work experience generally correlate with higher income levels and job expertise.
        - **Number of Dependents:** Enter the number of dependents you have. Dependents can influence your financial responsibilities and household expenses.
        - **Household Size:** Enter the total number of people living in your household. Household size affects your living expenses and financial planning.
        - **Age:** Enter your age. Age is an important factor in income prediction and financial advice, as it correlates with career stage, earning potential, and retirement planning.
